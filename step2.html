			<h3>User Analysis</h3>
			<p class="text-justify">
				After the covid 19 pandemic hit the world, food delivery apps like like
				Doordash and Ubereats have become quite popular. Busy individuals many
				times rely on getting food delivered as it's easy and thanks to these
				apps, food delivery has revolved on it's feet. With apps supporting
				multiple features like multiple restaurant options, different cusines,
				interactive delivery details with live geotagging, food delivery has
				made huge advancements in recent years. Having said that, these apps
				still lack some features which could be added for the good. One such
				feature is preemptive warning to prevent food allergy. Sometimes people
				want to place order as soon as possible, and in this hurry they end up
				ordering food that they are allergic to. Through our preemptive warning
				we want to alert user if they are ordering allergens.

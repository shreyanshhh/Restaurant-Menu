            <li>
              When ordering food online, people sometime accidentally order food
              items that they might be allergic to.
            </li>
            <li>
              When ordering through our app, if you add items that you are
              allergic to, then we will give you a warning to reduce order
              mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              When user registers, we will get their allergen information.
            </li>
            <li>
              We provide clean UI for finding restaurant and adding food item to
              cart.
            </li>
            <li>
              If user adds food item that they are allergic to, then they are
              presented with warning. They can also disregard the warning for
              cases when they are ordering for their friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              After placing order, user can also track order status in the
              application

            <li>
              The users were a little confused with the different profile
              creation steps and needed briefing on how consumer and restaurant
              owner profiles are different.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users pointed out that restaurant owners might find it
              difficult to go through exhaustive lists of ingredients. Sorting
              them into categories might seem helpful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users were concerned about the privacy issues and giving down
              terms and conditions that are GDPR complaint can make them believe
              that the app is GDPR complaint.

              The main difference was in the navigation of different pages
              across the app, back buttons were added in the final design to
              help user easily navigate to previous visited page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within the Restaurant menu different categories tab has been added
              above the search bar to increase the flexibility.
            </li>
            <li>The warning sign has been updated to be more user friendly</li>
            <li>
              The order page now displays the order quantity and price of each
              ordered item.

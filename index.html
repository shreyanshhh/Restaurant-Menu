  <h2>Preemptive warning to prevent food allergy</h2>
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>
    As a user when I order food from apps like Doordash or Ubereats, I am not aware if I accidentally ordered food which
    I might be allergic to.
  </p>
  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>
    As a user I should get an alert beforehand if I'm allergic to the food that I'm ordering.
  </p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We will take user's allergy details at the time of creation of their profile. We will save the allergy data and
      associate it with the user.
    </li>
    <li>
      When restaurant is uploading their menu, we need to know food content so that we can show user correct
      ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the user is ordering the food that they are allergic to then they will get a warning. The warning will let user
      know that they are allergic to the food they are about to order. User would have a choice whether to change order or
      ignore the warning.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Potential obstacles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>  
      When user is providing allergy data we need to make sure that their personal health data is saved in highly
      encrypted database and product is GDPR compliant.
    </li>
    <li>  
      Restaurant may not provide enough information and therefore we may need to hire a nutritionist who curates the food
      and its contents. This process can be tedious for a region with large number of restaurants.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reduce the potential risk of food poisoning among users.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduction of food wastage.
    </li>
  </ul>

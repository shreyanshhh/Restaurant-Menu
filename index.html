			<h2>Preemptive warning to prevent food allergy</h2>
			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p class="text-justify">
				After the covid 19 pandemic hit the world, food delivery apps like like
				Doordash and Ubereats have become quite popular. Busy individuals many
				times rely on getting food delivered as it's easy and thanks to these
				apps, food delivery has revolved on it's feet. With multiple restaurant
				options, different cusines, interactive delivery details with live
				geotagging, food delivery has made huge advancements. Having said that,
				these apps still lack some features which could be added for the good.
				One such feature is preemptive warning to prevent food allergy.
				Sometimes people want to place order as soon as possible, and in this
				hurry they end up ordering food that they are allergic to. Through our
				preemptive warning we want to alert user if they are ordering allergens.
			</p>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<ul class="text-justify">
				<li>
					As a person ordering food on app, I should should be able to place
					order easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					As a person ordering food on app, I should get an alert beforehand if
					I'm ordering allergens.
				</li>
				<li>
					As a person ordering food on app, I should be able to neglect the
					warning for the cases when I'm ordering food for my friend who is not
					allergic.
				</li>
				<li>
					As a restaurant owner registering as vendor on the app, I should be
					able to add all ingredients of the dishes.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Actions</h3>
			<ul class="text-justify">
				<li>User should be able to register/login to the app</li>
				<li>
					User should be able to setup their profile. They should be able to
					setup allergy details when setting their profile.
				</li>
				<li>
					User should get warning when ordering allergens. User should be able
					to neglect warning if needed.
				</li>
				<li>User should be able to place order easily.</li>
				<li>
					Restaurant owner should be able to enter all ingredients of the dish
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Potential obstacles</h3>
			<ul class="text-justify">
				<li>
					User data need to be handled safely in an end to end encrypted
					environment. Product should be GDPR compliant.
				</li>
				<li>
					Restaurant owner need to enter ingredients accurately. This process
					can be tedious for a region with large number of restaurants.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Impact</h3>
			<ul class="text-justify">
				<li>Reduce the potential risk of food poisoning among users.</li>
				<li>Reduction of food wastage.</li>
			</ul>

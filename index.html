Problem Statement - As a user when I order food from apps like Doordash or Ubereats, I am not aware if I accidentally ordered food which I might be allergic to.<br/>

Goal - As a user I should get an alert beforehand if I'm allergic to the food that I'm ordering.<br/>

Actions -<br/>
  + We will take user's allergy details at the time of creation of their profile. We will save the allergy data and associate it with the user.<br/>
  + When restaurant is uploading their menu, we need to know food content so that we can show user correct ingredients.<br/>
  + If the user is ordering the food he/she is allergic to then they will get a warning stating that he/she is ordering the food that they are allergic to and would have a choice whether to ignore or move forward with the order.<br/>

Potential obstacles -<br/>
  + When user is providing allergy data we need to make sure that their personal health data is saved in highly encrypted database and product is GDPR compliant.<br/>
  + Restaurant may not provide enough information and for that we may need to hire a nutritionist who curates the food and its contents. This process can be tedious for a region with large number of restaurants.<br/>

Impact -<br/>
  + Reduce the potential risk of food poisoning among users.<br/>
  + Reduction of food wastage.<br/>
